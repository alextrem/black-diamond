# BLACK-DIAMOND

Amplifier build on a class A design. No fancy or excotic transistors are used. Standard transistors like BC550(BC850) or BC847 will do the amplification.

A small microcontroller [MSP430] (http://www.ti.com) will do the survaillance of voltage, current and errors. Longtime testing and logging will be done on an external SD-CARD.
